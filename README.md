# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is a web page written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a Rock Paper Scissors game that can be played between a user and a computer. The page consists of a header with the title of the game, a scoreboard that displays the scores of the user and the computer, a result section that displays the outcome of the game, a choices section where the user can select their move, and an action message that displays the status of the game. The footer contains the name of the developer and the copyright year.

The HTML code defines the structure of the page, the CSS code is used to style the page and make it visually appealing, and the JavaScript code handles the logic of the game.

The game works as follows: the user selects their move by clicking on one of the three icons (rock, paper, or scissors) and the computer randomly selects its move. The moves are compared, and the winner is determined based on the game's rules. The outcome of the game is displayed in the result section, and the scores of the user and the computer are updated in the scoreboard. The action message displays the current status of the game, such as "Make your move" or "You win!".

The game uses event listeners to detect when the user clicks on one of the icons and then calls functions to handle the game's logic. The functions generate a random move for the computer, compare the moves, update the scores, and display the outcome of the game. The game also uses CSS classes to add visual effects to the icons and the result section, such as adding a glow effect to the winning move.
